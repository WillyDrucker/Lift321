Create and publish new branch Claude-v1.0.6

Please do not auto commit changes, this is in your documentation to not even ask. It's fine it's committed for now, but we need to address this going forward.

So just curious, it was mentioned in the CLAUDE.md not to ask or autocommit, is there something that could have been worded better in that file?

---

No that's fine, I was just curious as to what happened. I love you having system level instructions and let's keep if that way. If we run into this again we'll adjust together.

I'm also excited you're excited for the project too. :) Let's create a second "Create New Account" page after clicking the "Next" button. Using our standards to establish the new page, black background for now, usually we use dark gray, we will establish that later I'm sure. Let's put the exact chevron and next buttons at the bottom, same everything. 32dp from the bottom we're going to add some text, all in white for now same font size for now as the current "Create New Account" text. "3-2-1 Challenge We're So Confident That The Lift 3-2-1 System Is The Most Humanly Optimal That The App Is 100% Free While Using A 3-2-1 Plan" Might be a lot there, lets see how it fits.

Change USING to FOLLOWING

Let's make the text the same dp size as the first "Create New Account" page

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:09:00Z
---
What is the spacing in all of the text in the "Create New Account" first page, from line to line, 10dp?

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:10:00Z
---
I'd like to see the tight spacing, and please fix the original "Create New Account" page spacing so it's all 2dp consistently. I'd like to see the same spacing on signuppage2. Also what is the dp size and xxl? weight? of the font in the first signuppage

What was the web host you suggested for this app?

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:12:00Z
---
For a landing page domain name

I use Netlify currently and I'm happy with it, what about Vercel, is it a better choice, one better than the oter?

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:14:00Z
---
Will netlify handle the same traffic as vercel and be as secure?

Is the devdoc agent running? I haven't seen any prompts stored in the USERPROMPT folder

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:16:00Z
---
I see, don't turn it on and disable the agent. I will create a more simplistic agent.

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:17:00Z
---
please disable devdoc-agent and enable prompt-saver, we'll see how the overhead is

---
Timestamp: 2025-11-11T00:18:00Z
---
Is there anyway to go back and scrape all of the prompts submitted in this session and hand it to prompt-saver?

---

Let's do option 1. just cram it all in there.
